Create a loop that will:
1. print out the numbers form 0-99 (inclusive), except for multiples of 3. Use `%` modulus. Use `continue` for this.
2. print out the numbers from 50 to 100 counting by 5. If the counter variable gets
higher than 75, `break` out out the loop.
3. Print out the numbers from 3 to 600 counting by 10, except for multiples of 5 (use `continue`), break if the counter exceeds `550`.
5. add up all the numbers fom 50 to 75. `break` when the total reaches or exceeds `570`.
6. add up all the multiples of 5 from 0-100, `break` when the total exceeds `150`.
7. Create a program that will find the 127th multiple of 7. 
8. When adding up all the numbers from `1-...`, what is the number that causes the
total to exceed `100 000`?
10. Create a program that will find the `n`th fibbonacci number. Start the sequence with `1`.
11. Create a loop that will add user integer input until they enter a negative number.

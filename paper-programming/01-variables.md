# Tracing Variables

## 1.1 Variables and simple math
```python
a = 5
b = 4
c = a + b
```

## 1.2 Variables and simple math
```python
a = 8
b = a
c = b - a
```

## 1.3 Variables and division vs 
### integer (floor) division
```python
a = 4
b = 1
c = b / a
d = b // a
```



## 1.4 Variables and string 
### concatenation
```python
a = "Hello"
b = "World"
c = a + b
```


## 1.5 Variables and incrementing
```python
a = 5
a = a + 2
b = a
a = a + 1
b = b + a
```

## 1.6 Variables and increment operators
```python
a = 8
a += 3
b = a
a += 2
b += a
```

## 1.7 Variables and increment operator 2
```python
total = 0
total += 1
total += 1
total += 1
total += 1
```

## 1.8 Variables and increment operator 3
```python
total = 0
num = 0
total += num
num += 1
total += num
num += 1
total += num
num += 1
total += num
```

## 1.9 Variables and increment operator 4
```python
word = ""
word += "h"
word += "e"
word += "l"
word += "l"
word += "o"
```

## 1.10 Variables and increment operator 5
```python
word = ""
word = "h" + word
word = "e" + word
word = "l" + word
word = "l" + word
word = "o" + word
```

## 1.11 Variables and increment operator 6 
```python
cup1 = 0
cup2 = 1
cup3 = 0
cup1 = cup1 + 1
cup2 = cup1 - 1
cup3 = cup1
cup1 = cup1 * 0
cup2 = cup3
cup3 = cup1
cup1 = cup2 % 1
cup3 = cup2
cup2 = cup3 - cup3
```

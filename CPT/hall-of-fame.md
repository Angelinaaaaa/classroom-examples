*by Sean and Stephen* - ICS2O

Lasers and Platforms is a platformer game where the player tries to continuously reach the next platform while avoiding the increasingly rapid border closing from underneath. In addition, the player must dodge vertical lasers from the bottom of the screen which will slowly eat away at your health. The score is accumulated by the frames passed after the countdown into the game.


## [Escape Room](https://github.com/ICS2O-Gallo/10c-cpt-jin)
*by Jin* - ICS2O

An escape-room.


## [Plane Game](https://github.com/ICS2O-Gallo/10c-cpt-timothy-and-nicholas)
*by Nicholas and Timothy* - ICS2O

A pun on plain game, Plane Game is a side-scrolling game based off of PyArcade. The objective of the game is to travel the longest distance by avoiding stars and collecting coins for upgrades. Players are encouraged to beat their previous high scores, which are stored in a non-volatile format, meaning that players can return to their game without losing their hard-fought records. As players progress in the level, the obstacles move faster! How far can your plane go?

*by Alex and Shaan* - ICS2O

[Video Solution](https://youtu.be/55T5FUtDzVE)

## Knowldge requirements
- How to open the terminal
- How to create a directory
- How to use the `tree` program
- Moving a file from one folder to another
- Renaming a file or folder
- Deleting a file and folder.

Do the whole activity in a linux terminal (with the exception of `#5`).

1. Create a directory called `terminal-practice` with the following file structure:
    ```
    terminal-practice/
    ├── blue.txt
    ├── pract1
    ├── pract2
    │   ├── goodbye.py
    │   └── hello.txt
    └── README.md

    ```

2. Use the `tree` command on the `terminal-practice` directory to compare your directory structure with the one shown above.

3. Move `blue.txt` to the `pract1` folder.

4. Rename the `pract2` folder to whatever.

5. Open VS Code and put some text in the files. Save the files.

6. Delete the `pract1` folder.

Your final file structure should be:
```
terminal-practice/
├── README.md
└── whatever
    ├── goodbye.py
    └── hello.txt
```
